				<h1>Our company</h1>
				<img src="assets/img/Capcom.jpg">
				<p>Capcom Co., Ltd. ( Hepburn: Kabushiki-gaisha Kapukon) is a Japanese video game developer and publisher.It has created a number of multi-million-selling game franchises, with its most commercially successful being Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Dead Rising, Marvel vs. Capcom, and Ace Attorney. Mega Man, himself serves as the official mascot of the company. Established in 1979, it has become an international enterprise with subsidiaries in East Asia (Hong Kong), Europe (London, England), and North America (San Francisco, California)
				Development studios
				In its beginning few years, Capcom's Japan branch had three development groups referred to as "Planning Rooms", led by Tokuro Fujiwara, Takashi Nishiyama and Yoshiki Okamoto. Later, games developed internally were created by several numbered "Production Studios", each assigned to different games. Starting in 2002, the development process was reformed to better share technologies and expertise, and the individual studios were gradually restructured into bigger departments responsible for different tasks. While there are self-contained departments for the creation of arcade, pachinko and pachislo, online, and mobile games, the Consumer Games R&D Division is an amalgamation of subsections in charge of game development stages.
				</p>
				<h4>Capcom has three internal Consumer Games Development divisions:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Division 1, headed by Jun Takeuchi, with Resident Evil, Mega Man, Devil May Cry, Dead Rising, and other major franchises (usually targeting global audiences).</li>
						<li>Division 2, headed by Ryozo Tsujimoto (who also the heads Mobile Online Development Division) with Monster Hunter, Ace Attorney, Onimusha, Sengoku Basara, and other franchises with more traditional IP (usually targeting audiences in Asia).</li>
						<li>Division 3, with Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, Lost Planet, Dragon's Dogma, and other online-focused franchises (games focused on online multiplayer and/or tournaments).</li>

					</ul>


				<p>
					In addition to these teams, Capcom commissions outside development studios to ensure a steady output of titles. However, following poor sales of Dark Void and Bionic Commando, its management has decided to limit outsourcing to sequels and newer versions of installments in existing franchises, reserving the development of original titles for its in-house teams. The production of games, budgets, and platform support are decided on in development approval meetings, attended by the company management and the marketing, sales and quality control departments.</p>
