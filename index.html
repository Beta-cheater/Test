				<h1>Devil may cry</h1>
				<img src="assets/gif/DMC1.gif">
				<p>Devil may cry is a series of action-adventure games created by Hideki Kamiya. It is primarily developed and published by Capcom. The series centers on the demon hunter Dante and his efforts to thwart various demon invasions of Earth. Its gameplay consists of combat scenes in which the player must attempt to extend long chains of attacks, avoiding damage and exhibiting stylized combat; this combat, along with time and the number of items collected and used, are considered in grading the player's performance. Across the series, new characters with unique skills are available.
				The series alludes to Dante's Divine Comedy. Hideki Kamiya created Devil May Cry after a failed attempt to develop a Resident Evil game with the first game originally being conceived as Resident Evil 4. Kamiya wanted to create a game with more action features, which Capcom felt the series did not need. The games were directed by Hideaki Itsuno and writer Bingo Morihashi. Capcom announced a new game, DmC: Devil May Cry (developed by Ninja Theory and supervised by Capcom), during the 2010 Tokyo Game Show. A high-definition remastering of the three PlayStation 2 titles was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012, and in 2018 for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. The latest game is Devil May Cry 5, released on March 8, 2019.
				The series has been successful; the main entries have sold several million copies and received Capcom's Platinum Title award. The success of the video-game series has led to comic books, novelizations, an animated series, guides, collectibles, publications, and a variety of action figures. Critical response to the gameplay combos has been positive. However, the games' narrative was considered simple until the third installment.

				According to Eurogamer, another Capcom franchise, Strider, was a vital influence on the Devil May Cry franchise, and according to Retro Gamer, the over-the-top action of Devil May Cry draws from Strider, particularly in their inclusion of the "boss rush".

				<h1>Game overview</h1>
				<img src="assets/gif/DMC2.gif">
				<ul>
					<li>Devil May Cry: Its gameplay focuses on fast-paced, highly-stylized combat; a high style ranking requires long attack and evasion strings while avoiding damage. Although the game also features puzzle-solving and exploration elements retained from its survival-horror origins, they are downplayed in favor of action. In later games, the system was modified; players had to vary their attacks to maintain their style rank. The Devil Trigger enables a player's character to assume a devilish form with additional powers (based on their current weapon), while the character's strength and speed increase, and health is slowly restored.</li>
					<li>Devil May Cry 2: Dante is generally the game's lead character. Two other playable characters, Lucia and Trish are also available. The ability to perform combination attacks in mid-air and evasion and weapon-change buttons were introduced. With the latter, a player can cycle through ranged weapons without switching to the inventory screen</li>
					<li>Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening: A selection of gameplay styles were added, allowing the player to focus on favorite techniques or weapons. Each of the four styles gains experience points, which unlock more techniques and abilities without costing red orbs (the series' currency). A second weapon-change button was added, allowing the player to cycle through a character's melee weaponry. The game was re-released as Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition with new skills for Dante and the ability to play as Vergil.</li>
					<li>Devil May Cry 4: Nero's Devil Bringer arm gives players the ability to pull distant enemies in to be attacked or destroyed. Nero is also armed with a sword which can be throttled up, allowing players to pre-charge it for extra damage on the next hit; with precise timing, it can be charged after each attack for extra damage and style. As Dante, players can switch fighting styles in mid-combat. An updated version titled Special Edition was rereleased featuring the ability to play as Vergil as well as Dante's two mates, Trish and Lady.</li>
					<li>Devil May Cry HD Collection: A collection of the series' first three games for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, ported by Pipeworks Software and Double Helix Games, eventually released on March 22, 2012 in Japan and March 29, 2012 in the US. It was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Microsoft Windows on March 13, 2018</li>
					<li>DmC: Devil May Cry: This title in the Devil May Cry series introduced changing environments to the gameplay. Players could reach hidden areas with the Ophion whip and grappling hook, and the weapon had similar functions to the Devil Bringer in Devil May Cry 4. The environment often "attacked" Dante by changing its architecture and infrastructure to a more-hostile form, prompting fast-paced chase sequences and platforming scenarios</li>
					<li>Devil May Cry 5: Released in 2019, this game introduces a character named V, who controls three demons in battle due to his weak physical state. Nero and Dante return as playable characters, although Nero is weaker with the replacement of his Devil Bringer by a mechanical prosthesis</li>
